What's new?

ShoppingService:
- #839 A new method, PaymentValidate, has been added. This method gets called from PSP (Klarna in this case) and enables us to perform prepayment validations. Clients can send in an additional validation url, which gets called if specified, in order to enable application specific validations.
https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Shopping/Operations/PaymentValidate

ProductService:
- #1615 A new method overload, ListProductsByIds3, has been added to support pagination and filtering. This conforms to the other ListProducts-methods. 
https://services.enferno.se/api/1.1/docs/#/Products/Operations/ListProductsByIds3

- #1616 A new Property on ProductParametric, SortOrder, has been added. This allows applications to merge parametrics from variants with the product and maintain the sort order.

What's fixed?

ShoppingService:
- #983 Saved baskets are now excluded from validation of correct pricelists when fetching the basket. Previously invalid pricelists could be replaced. This will not happen for saved baskets now.

Miscellaneous changes? 

ProductService:
- #845 Performance issues for ListProductFilters have been addressed. Rewrite of SearchProductLite have been performed and we are now utilizing more parallelism when getting all product data from the database.

Feedback?
Faults and strange behavior can be reported to support@storm.io or to patrik.rosquist@storm.io.
