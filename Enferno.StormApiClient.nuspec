## What's new?

### OrderService:

## What's fixed?

### CustomerService:
- #2798 Company.Pricelists now only gets populated with active company pricelist.

### OrderService:
- #2212: Due to performance problems with OrderList and ListOrders, ListOrder2 they have now been deprecated. There is now a new ListOrders3 with a more light weight resultset, OrderPagedList2 with items as OrderListItem. Basically all references to DeliveryNotes have been removed from list results. The Order entity should be unchanged.

## Miscellaneous changes?

- #2664: We now have an API client for PHP which is located at  
https://github.com/StormCommerce/Storm.API-client-php  
It can be used by those building solutions using PHP.
